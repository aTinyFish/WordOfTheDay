Word Of The Day
===============

A simple app showing how to implement a Notification Center extension (widget) with the following features:

- An embedded framework to share code
- A shared container to share data
- Ability to launch & refresh the main app from the widget

This app requires iOS 8. To get it working, you'll need to update the team for both the main target and the widget target. Then, ensure app groups is enabled under capabilities, and enter your own app group identifier. Update any insances of "group.aTinyFish.WordOfTheDay" in the code with the app group identifier you created.
